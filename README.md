NuCafé: AI-Driven Personalized Dining Architecture
NuCafé is a high-fidelity digital cafeteria ecosystem that replaces static menu browsing with an intelligent, predictive recommendation engine. Inspired by industry-leading content discovery platforms, NuCafé leverages machine learning to anticipate user preferences, transforming food procurement into a data-driven, personalized experience.

Strategic Vision
Traditional dining applications rely on manual user navigation. NuCafé disrupts this paradigm through:

Predictive Modeling: Anticipating user intent through historical data.
Behavioral Synthesis: Mapping user-item interactions to identify latent preferences.
Dynamic Personalization: Real-time scoring that evolves with every user interaction.
Core Architecture & Problem Solvation
1. Collaborative Filtering: The Latent Factor Engine
Challenge: How can the system identify complex behavioral patterns and "taste clusters" across a diverse user base?

Implementation: We utilize Matrix Factorization (Singular Value Decomposition - SVD) to decompose the User-Item interaction matrix into low-dimensional latent vectors. This enables:

Identification of hidden correlations between disparate menu items.
Automated discovery of new items based on the preferences of mathematically similar users.
Enhanced accuracy in predicting the rating a user would provide for an item they have yet to experience.
2. Content-Based Filtering: The Taste DNA Engine
Challenge: How does the system mitigate the "Cold-Start" problem for new users or those with niche dietary restrictions?

Implementation: A Heuristic Content-Matching Engine analyzes item metadata—including category, price point, and preparation metrics—against the user’s established ordering profile.

Example: If a user’s historical data shows a 0.70 affinity for caffeinated beverages, the ranking engine dynamically inflates the priority of the beverage category in the real-time feed.

Result: High-relevance personalization from the first interaction, regardless of the density of the global interaction matrix.

Technical Logic: Weighted Hybrid Ensemble
NuCafé employs a multi-objective ranking function to balance individual preferences with platform-wide trends:

Deployment & Execution
Environment Setup:

pip install streamlit pandas numpy sqlalchemy scikit-learn
Model Training:

python train_ai.py
This initializes the latent vector space and generates the simple_data.pkl weights.

Application Launch:

streamlit run app.py
Future Roadmap: Market Basket Analysis
The next phase of development focuses on Association Rule Mining (Apriori/Eclat algorithms) to implement intelligent cross-selling logic. This will allow the system to:

Identify complementary item pairings.
Automate "Frequently Bought Together" suggestions.
Optimize Average Order Value (AOV) through statistically-backed upselling.
